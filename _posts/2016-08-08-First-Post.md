## About myself

Hi! I am Mandy and I study Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

I focused on math and stats in the first two years of my undergrad, I found my passion in artificial intelligence, including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing in the recent two years. Besides math, computer science and statistics, I also took many microeconomics courses. The ideas of economics are incredibly useful while making decisions in real life.

I love travelling and would love to travel around the world and make great friends. To the right is one of the most recent photo of myself, and it also encapsulates my new hobby that I recently developed.
